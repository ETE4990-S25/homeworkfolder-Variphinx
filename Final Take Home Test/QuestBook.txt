Quest 1


A worthy challenge for sure

Starting with the grand masters spell used to read the scroll, I first wanted to find out how much scroll data was necessary to download by making a list of all the dates needed

Referring to the grand masters lecture on threading proved cruicial, as there were very helpful examples on doing this exact process

Thread pools proved to be necessary and helpful, downloading the data in chunks made it fun to watch as the Rates folder filled with json files




Quest 2


I am feeling motivated and ready to now analyze this data and find trends

The last lab was very fun using matplotlib and seaborn to visually look at data (lab 11) 

Although I did have some issues with the data side of it (not knowing what plot to use or how to show a correlation between data)

I think I have a better understanding now and I think this dataset will be much easier to work with
